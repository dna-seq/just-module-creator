# Roadmap

Active-only, forward-only. One `## RMn — name` per **open** item. Shipped and
deferred items move to [ROADMAP_HISTORY.md](ROADMAP_HISTORY.md) with their
rationale; nothing is deleted, only relocated.

**An item belongs here only if the work is ours.** A gap whose fix lives in
`just-dna-format` / `-compiler` / `-enricher` / `-registry` is filed upstream as
an `S<n>` and tracked in
[just-dna-format-pending-fixes.md](just-dna-format-pending-fixes.md) as an
`F<n>` — never as a roadmap item, because putting it here says we intend to build
something and invites a workaround where a note was owed. A probe belongs in
[dogfooding.md](dogfooding.md), not here.

## RM6 — two literature parsers have no fixture, so nothing tests them

**Severity:** medium · **Status:** open · **Owner:** unassigned

`parse_semantic_scholar` and `parse_arxiv` are exercised by nothing. Every other
parser has a real captured payload under `assets/literature/`; these two do not,
because both services answer HTTP 429 to this machine's IP regardless of
user-agent or pacing — arXiv on a first request with no prior traffic, confirmed
with plain `curl` outside the client.

The block itself is not a defect anywhere and not ours to fix. **The untested
parser is ours**, and a parser with no test breaks silently when the API shape
moves.

Two ways out, not exclusive: capture the fixtures from a host that is not
blocked, or set `S2_API_KEY` — Semantic Scholar's keyed pool is not the one being
throttled — and capture at least that half. Recorded as **F6** in
[dogfooding.md](dogfooding.md).

## Idea book

Freeform, unscheduled, no commitment implied.

- A `module_diff` tool: two spec directories in, the authored rows that differ
  out. `module_signature` answers *whether* two specs differ but not *where*, and
  "diff the tables" is the standing advice whenever a digest moves without an
  intended content change.
- Surfacing `hints.REDUNDANCY_BEARING` as a resource rather than only as a field
  on `describe_table`, so an agent can read the whole list once instead of per table.
