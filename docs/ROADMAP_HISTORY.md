## RM1 — the drafting path is unwrapped, so the authoring loop has a hole in the middle

**Shipped:** 2026-08-11 · `draft_from_clinvar` (essentials), `draft_from_cpic` and
`draft_from_clinpgx` (extended), in `tools/passes.py`.

The skill taught `scaffold -> draft -> curate -> ...` and `draft` was CLI-only, so
an agent left the tool surface at step 2 and came back at step 4.

**Its stated difficulty was stale and is worth recording as such.** RM1 said
wrapping was hard because `draft` "refuses and lists the choices when a
`(phenotype, drug)` pair spans several populations". Upstream removed that in
0.5.1: `DiplotypeRow.clinical_context` keeps the settings as distinct rows and
the consumer picks at query time, so `population` is now a plain filter. Our own
`SKILL.md` and `DOMAIN.md` still claimed the old behaviour and were corrected in
the same change.

What *did* constrain the design was licensing, and that part held: `use` is
required with no default on all three tools, enforced at the schema layer, and a
licence refusal comes back as `skipped=true` with its reason rather than as a
failure — because a failure invites retrying with a different `use`, which is
fabricating a licence position to get data.

Three tools rather than one with a `source` argument: the upstream signatures
share almost nothing, and a merged tool would carry twelve arguments most of
which are inapplicable per source. `lookup_identifier(kind=...)` merges because
both kinds take the same pair; these do not.

## RM2 — the fact passes are unwrapped

**Shipped:** 2026-08-11 · `enrich_facts` (frequencies, gene_metrics, dosage) and
`enrich_literature_pass`, both extended and both background tasks.

One tool for the three sidecar passes because they share a shape — spec in,
sidecar out — and `dosage` writes onto `gene_metrics.csv` rather than a file of
its own. `use` applies only to `dosage`, so the result names where it landed in
`declared_use_applied_to` rather than letting the argument look universally
meaningful. That remains the softest seam in the design.

`enrich_literature_pass` stayed separate: it is keyed on `studies.csv` rather
than on variants, and its answer is a coverage sentence rather than a row count.

## RM5 — `lint_rows` promises refusals it does not currently produce

**Shipped:** 2026-08-11 · docstring and field description narrowed.

Resolved by narrowing the promise rather than by synthesizing alterations
upstream never made: `to_alterations` exists to carry upstream's distinctions
field-for-field, not to fabricate them. The docstring now says where the
redundancy-bearing columns actually appear on this tool — as `info` findings —
and that refusals come from the lookup tools.

Recorded as **F2**, now in [previous_issues.md](previous_issues.md).
