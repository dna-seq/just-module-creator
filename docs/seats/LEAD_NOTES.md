# Lead — notes

The lead seat's working state, rewritten to the present before a reset (`docs/seats/LEAD.md`).

## Now

Released 0.48.1 (tag `v0.48.1`, 2026-11-05). Unreleased on `main`: F31 and F50 (`5dfb942`, in
`docs/CHANGELOG.md` under Unreleased); it goes out with the next release, at most one a day. The person went
away at 05:02Z on 2026-11-05; the first unattended pass is below.

## Plan states (set 2026-11-05)

- RM16, RM25: waits until 2026-12-05. RM24: waits until 2027-01-05. Each line says what is looked at then.
- RM28: blocked on desk #203, yes after a present (the trait-term search tool; a minor).
- RM31: blocked on desk #204, no default (format's S125 was accepted for their 0.8, so the design's ground moved).
- RM18: blocked on desk #205 (whether this seat drafts the handout for Anton); owner the person.
- The "Owed to just-dna-lite" section had been done on 2026-09-26; moved to `ROADMAP_HISTORY.md`.
- No plan watcher runs for this seat (`classes/lead/plan-watch.py`); asking the seat-builder is on the to-file list.

## Findings (the tester's inbox)

- Fixed: F31, F50 (`5dfb942`).
- F34 (each publish uploads the previous `published.json`): the upload is the registry client's
  `gather_spec_files`, filed upstream long ago as registry `S5`; nothing here to fix.
- F22 (`published.json` records `owner: null`): needs a call on what "owner" means (namespace owner or the
  account that published) and whether a `whoami` per publish is worth a request on a rate-limited polygon.
  Next: the account name in the saved account is a no-request answer for a saved token; a session token has none.

## To file (unattended)

- To the seat-builder: a `plan` watcher (`classes/lead/plan-watch.py`) for this lead in `.blueprints.toml`.
- Pyright: clean since the codex-install test narrows its pipes (was 4 errors before this seat).

## First seating, 2026-11-05

- **The repository's own machinery against the kit's.** Retired: the hand-run NIGHT-RELAY protocol in
  `CLAUDE.md` §9 (the card rack, watchdog and unattended mode do it). Kept: `scripts/bench_score.py` and
  `scripts/page_budget.py` (this repository's own operational one-offs, nothing the kit does), and the
  tracked `.claude/settings.json` (it only pins the plugin, with no hooks or wakers). Git hooks were the
  samples only.
- **Watchers**: `watch.desk`, `watch.issues`, `watch.brief` started.
- **Picture**: a platypus with a DNA strand, set 2026-11-05 from the admin seat's reply.
- **`CLAUDE.md`**: read-first list names `docs/seats/README.md`; §7 says the tester finds and the lead fixes,
  and that the liaison keeps `docs/just-dna-format-pending-fixes.md`.
- **Leak gate**: `.leak_words` written (home and scratch paths, host forms of the hostname, the chat server,
  the person's joined name), `bin/leak-gate.sh install` on, tested on a sample line.
- **Open issues**: none on the repository.
- **Trust register (`docs/TRUST.md`)**: the person declined, 2026-11-05: "no, not now". Not asked again
  unless something changes what the plugin can reach.
- **Downward wake**: asked `longevity-loci/lead` in `#agent-chat>wake_from` to add `just-module-creator/lead`
  to its lead's and liaison's `wake_from`; done there in their cdd95d3.
- **Kit pin**: moved to 0.1.130 on its announcement, 2026-11-05 (`move-to-tag.py`; the pin is in the untracked
  `.claude/settings.local.json`). The person's `/reload-plugins` takes it into this session.

## Open

- Nothing from the first seating.
