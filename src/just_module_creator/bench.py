"""Score a benchmark run. The command line is `scripts/bench_score.py`.

Deterministic: same inputs, same bytes out. Wraps `compare_modules`'
`_compare` rather than re-deriving a diff, so the score can never drift from
what the shipped tool says — a hand-rolled comparison is a second opinion
nobody asked for and it disagrees eventually.

**Engine, not a tool surface.** Nothing here is registered with the MCP server, so
its models live in this module rather than in `models.py` — the rule there is that
every *tool* returns a model from `models.py`, and `overrides.py` is the precedent
for a pydantic model at engine level. If a `bench_score` tool is ever added, its
return type moves to `models.py` and these become its inputs.

**Three modes, in rank order, because three questions are being asked.**
`--fixture` is the **primary** one and is the manuscript's own protocol: did this
run recover the adjudicated answer — the right rows, the right directions. The
default mode is **secondary** and needs no adjudication: run-to-run agreement,
which is
reference-relative and answers *did this run reproduce that one*. The census is
reference-free and answers *what does this run assert* — which is the only form
available to a paper that will never have a reference, and it is the shape the
corrected benchmark criterion needs: a source running no association test should
produce rows asserting no direction, and zero rows and sixty honest rows are both
passes. The census **reports and does not judge**: the expectation for a given
paper is a sentence in the round's results, never a threshold in here.

**Either mode locates the spec directory.** Benchmark runs put `module_spec.yaml`
at the run root, under `spec/`, or under `longevity_*/`, and all three satisfy the
ask that produced them. A script assuming one shape silently scores nothing, so a
path with no `module_spec.yaml` is searched beneath, and zero or several matches
is an error naming what it found rather than a guess.

Prints JSON to stdout. Two properties matter and both are deliberate:

- **Volatile columns are excluded by name, and the exclusions are printed**
  in the output rather than applied silently. `fetched_at` moves on every run
  by construction and `curator` names who did the work, so neither is evidence
  about agreement; anything else that gets excluded has to be argued for here.
- **Key agreement and cell agreement are reported separately.** A run that
  authors the right variants with the wrong values, and one that authors half
  the variants perfectly, are different failures, and one score cannot say
  which happened.

`unscored` is not a zero. A table nothing could be counted over is reported as
absent, never folded into the denominator as a miss — the same rule the tools
apply to a check that could not run. **Two different tables land there and only
one was handled**: a table present on one side, and an *unkeyed* one present on
both, whose rows cannot be paired because upstream's `hints.key_fields` gives it
the `overlap` rule rather than `equality`. The second raised `TypeError` on the
first binning module it met, because the filter asked about `presence` when the
question is whether anything was counted.
